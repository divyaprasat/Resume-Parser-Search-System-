Process Flow:
Resume Extraction:

Resumes in PDF, DOC, and XML formats are uploaded and processed using LangChain.
The Gemini API extracts essential candidate details like Name, Email, Phone Number, and Skills.

Data Storage in Elasticsearch:

The extracted details are structured and pushed to Elasticsearch for efficient searching and retrieval.

Viewing Data via Flask API:

A Flask API is implemented to interact with Elasticsearch.
Users can  search candidates, and view structured resume data through API endpoints.
This system automates resume processing, improves search efficiency, and enables easy retrieval of relevant candidate information.
